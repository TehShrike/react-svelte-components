# TodoMVC - [Try It!](http://jihchi.github.io/react-elm-components)

This example is a simple TodoMVC.

This example is to get Svelte and JSX and everything working together. You may want to reuse some details of this configuration in your own projects.

## Build Instructions

Run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jihchi/react-svelte-components.git
cd react-svelte-components/example/
npm install
npm run serve
```

After downloading a bunch of stuff, this should compile `index.jsx` and `TodoMVC.svelte` into `build/bundle.js`. Assuming that all succeeds, it should open `index.html` in your browser automatically.

## Troubleshooting

If any intructions do not work, please ask about it on [the Svelte Gitter](https://gitter.im/sveltejs/svelte)! Folks there are friendly and happy to help. They can troubleshoot the problem and help find any issues with these directions.
